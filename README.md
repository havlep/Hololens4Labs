## About

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)
  
HoloLens4Labs is a mixed reality application designed for scientists working in chemical laboratories. This application was built in Unty and leverages the Microsoft HoloLens 2 to facilitate efficient and intuitive note-taking directly within the lab environment, syncing the results to an azure server backend.

<details open>
<summary>Additional info</summary>
<br>

This project was developed as part of my thesis and is currently in a stage of a prototype that will be further enhanced and used for a real world lab study in the near future. Although it was developed with the aim of being used primarely in the lab, the UI flow should be congruent with any work requiring note taking and hand free use.

### Key Features 
- **Hands-Free Note-Taking:** Use voice commands or simple gestures to create and manage notes without interrupting lab work.
- **Mixed Reality Integration:** Seamlessly overlay digital notes onto the physical lab space, enhancing information accessibility.
- **Image capture:** Capture images from your the surrounding envinronment and integrate them into notes. 
- **Text Transcription:** Quickly trancribe text from any objecte and edit it before it is saved as a note for future reference.
- **User-Centric Design:** Developed with a focus on ease of use and minimal disruption to existing lab workflow
